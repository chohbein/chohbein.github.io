  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
    <li>This passion project of mine is an end-to-end date pipeline to webscrape news articles from various sources, cluster similar articles, extract keywords, and summarize each article cluster into a concise paragraph. </li>
    <li>Scraping was done with Selenium, orchestrated by AWS Lambda + EC2 with a relational AWS RDS database for storage. </li>
    <li>Keyword extraction used a weighted ensemble of Part-of-Speech + Named Entity recognition (spaCy), Semantic-Relevance (KeyBERT), and manually-included common keywords.</li>
    <li>The article clustering process was decided by testing 2 different approaches:  <a href="https://aclanthology.org/W00-0403.pdf">Centroid-Based Summarization of Multiple Documents</a> vs
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08499">PRIMERA: Pyramid-based Masked Sentence Pre-Training for Multi-doc Summarizing</a>. Our testing found that PRIMARA gave better summaries; see the <a href="https://github.com/chohbein/newsapp/blob/main/README.md">project repo</a> for more info on my process. </li>

  <h4>Histopathologic Cancer Detection</h4>
  <p class="tech">Python · GPU Training · CNN · Torch · sklearn</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>This is my final project for a deep learning course. I compared 2 different CNN architectures to predict the presence of tumors in histopathologic images.</li>
  <li>One of the major achievements I took from this project was the performance tuning I made to work within the limits of my poor little laptop GPU. </li>
  <li>Initially, I was hit with long overheating and long training times. I resolved this with techniques such as mixed precision, multiple workers, image downsizing, and batch-size tuning.</li>
  <li>I approached model architecture by testing 2 different hypotheses: Because my visual analysis of the images showed no noticable indications of cancerous features, I suspected a model focused on fine-grained details would work best.</li>
  <li>H<sub>0</sub>: focus on fine-grained details
    <ul>
      <li>Small kernels to capture small, refined details</li>
      <li>Minimal pooling to maintain detail.</li>
      <li>Padding to maintain edge information.</li>
      <li>Light dropout to reduce overfitting while also maintaining its capacity to recognize subtle patterns.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>H<sub>a</sub>: a focus on broader trends in the images.
      <ul>
        <li>Larger kernels</li>
        <li>Aggressive pooling to emphasize large features.</li>
        <li>High dropout to help broad-feature neurons from learning noise.
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h7>Final improving steps</h7>
  <p class="tech">
    <ul>
      <li>Early stopping</li>
      <li>LR Scheduling</li>
      <li>Image alteration</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <b>Results</b>
  <p class="tech">
  Our model focusing on fine details within the images scored better. Thus, we accept our null hypothesis.
  After further improving steps, we concluded with the following:
  <br>
  <br>
  
  ROC-AUC:
  0.9813459611111561
  <br>
  [23973 2300]<br>
  [883 16849]
  <br>
  Prioritized false-negative rate down to 2%
